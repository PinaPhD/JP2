### SDN-enabled IoT-Edge Network for next-generation offshore wind farms

#### The Introduction
Determining the dependability of the proposed SDN-enabled IoT-Edge network 
is of utmost importance to wind farm developers.

#### The Model
The proposed SDN-enabled IoT-Edge network comprises _(1,...,n)_ sensors 
sending data samples to _(1,...,n)_ ECP nodes and _(1,...,n)_ vPAC nodes. 
The ECP and vPAC nodes send back actuation signals to _(1,...,n)_ actuators. 
These data samples and actuation signals are sent through _(1,...,n)_ OpenFlow-enabled 
switches. 

For this model,
- 10 sensors
- 10 ECP nodes
- 10 vPAC nodes
- 10 actuators
- 9 switches
- 3 controllers
